REACT SERIES
 
 Theoritical learnings:
 
 DAY 1:
 
 -> Library- It targets a specific functionality. While using a library , we are in control for flow of the code. Like we have a tool and we have the power when we have to use it within our application. Example: React
 
 -> Framework- It provides everything required to develop a complete application. While using a framework, it controls the flow of code. It is a blueprint like you have different blueprints of houses and you have to choose one of them. You have over the architecture because it is already defined in paper. Example: Bootstrap, tailwind.
 
-> React has unidirectional flow of data where parent node shared it's functions or data with the child node.

-> Babel is a js compiler that converts js code into version compatible with all browsers.

-> Hooks are functions that enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components.
