REACT SERIES
 
 Theoritical learnings:
 
 DAY 1:
 
 -> Library- It targets a specific functionality. While using a library , we are in control for flow of the code. Like we have a tool and we have the power when we have to use it within our application. Example: React
 
 -> Framework- It provides everything required to develop a complete application. While using a framework, it controls the flow of code. It is a blueprint like you have different blueprints of houses and you have to choose one of them. You have over the architecture because it is already defined in paper. Example: Bootstrap, tailwind.
 
-> React has unidirectional flow of data where parent node shared it's functions or data with the child node.

-> Babel is a js compiler that converts js code into version compatible with all browsers.

-> Hooks are functions that enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components. These are used for UI updation.

DAY 2:

-> React Fiber- The algorithm behind updating the virtual dom is fiber. When we are updating the virtual dom and on that time itself, many other updation calls are coming from the server, then we try to directly update according to final call.

KEY FEATURES OF FIBER: It includes the ability to pause, abort or reuse work as new updates are come in and the ability to assign priority to different types of updates.

-> Reconciliation- It is a recursive algorithm of react which reconsider whom to update or not. It differentiate one tree with another tree to determine which parts need to be change in the actual tree.
